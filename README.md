# Multi-Class-Animal-Classification
A deep learning model to classify images of animals into multiple classes using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset consists of labeled animal images categorized into distinct species. The model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras, and it leverages techniques such as data augmentation, normalization, and dropout to improve generalization and accuracy. The final model aims to achieve high accuracy in identifying animal species from input images, making it useful for wildlife monitoring, educational tools, and biodiversity research.
